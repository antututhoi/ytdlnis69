/**
 * How 69-Media Helper backs up and restores the other 69 apps. Keep this file identical in every app.
 *
 * Every 69 app has a small service (action ACTION_BACKUP) that only apps with the same signing key may use.
 * Backup:  helper sends MSG_BACKUP -> the app zips its own data and answers MSG_REPLY with KEY_URI (read access granted).
 *          The helper copies the zip, then sends MSG_CLEANUP.
 * Restore: helper sends MSG_RESTORE_PREPARE -> the app answers with an empty KEY_URI (write access granted),
 *          the helper writes the zip into it and sends MSG_RESTORE_APPLY -> the app unpacks it, answers, and closes itself.
